# Fast style transfer in PyTorch
This small example is adapted from https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style
and uses tensorboard logger from https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/tree/master/tutorials/04-utils/tensorboard.

The main part of the code is in `Style transfer.ipynb`.
